# HTML5-Canvas-Pong

AI paddle is hidden behind scrollbar. \*Hard coded in the height and width on the HTML side

Player paddle lost mouse control upon deployment. \*Don't understand why this one isn't working now

It was a fun mini project that worked previously. Maybe I circle back to fix after finishing more important lessons / projects.
